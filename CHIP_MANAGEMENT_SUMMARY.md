# Chip Management System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive chip management system that tracks active and inactive chips in local storage, displays counts on HomeScreen, and allows reassignment of inactive chips to vehicles.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Chip Manager Utility (`src/utils/chipManager.js`)
Created a centralized utility for managing chip data with the following functions:
- `getActiveChips()` - Get all active chips
- `getInactiveChips()` - Get all inactive chips
- `addActiveChip(chipData)` - Add chip to active array
- `addInactiveChip(chipData)` - Add chip to inactive array
- `removeActiveChip(chipId)` - Remove chip from active array
- `removeInactiveChip(chipId)` - Remove chip from inactive array
- `moveChipToInactive(chipId)` - Move chip from active to inactive
- `moveChipToActive(chipId, vehicleData)` - Move chip from inactive to active
- `findChip(chipId)` - Find chip in any array
- `getChipCounts()` - Get counts of active/inactive chips

### 2. VehicleDetailsScreen Updates
**When Assigning Chip:**
- Saves chip to active chips array in local storage
- Stores vehicle details (VIN, make, model, year, yardId, yardName)
- Updates vehicle's `chipId` and `isActive` status

**When Unassigning Chip:**
- Moves chip from active to inactive chips array
- Retains last vehicle information for reference
- Updates vehicle's `chipId` to null and `isActive` to false

### 3. HomeScreen Updates
**Dynamic Chip Counts:**
- Reads active chip count from active chips array
- Reads inactive chip count from inactive chips array
- Displays counts in chip stat cards
- Clicking "Active Chips" card navigates to ActiveChipScreen with type='active'
- Clicking "Inactive Chips" card navigates to ActiveChipScreen with type='inactive'

### 4. ActiveChipScreen Enhancements
**Display Modes:**
- **Active Chips:** Shows chips from active array with current vehicle info
  - Displays: VIN, Year, Make, Model, Chip ID, Current Yard
  - Clicking chip navigates to VehicleDetailsScreen
  - Shows "Active" status badge

- **Inactive Chips:** Shows chips from inactive array with last vehicle info
  - Displays: Last VIN, Year, Make, Model, Chip ID, Last Yard
  - Shows "Assign Vehicle" button on each chip
  - Cannot navigate to vehicle details (no active vehicle)

**Reassignment Flow for Inactive Chips:**
1. User clicks "Assign Vehicle" button on an inactive chip
2. **Step 1:** Modal opens showing list of available yards
   - Displays yard name and address
   - User selects a yard
3. **Step 2:** Shows vehicles in selected yard without chips
   - Displays VIN, year, make, model
   - User selects a vehicle
4. User confirms assignment
5. System updates:
   - Assigns chip to selected vehicle
   - Moves chip from inactive to active array
   - Updates vehicle's `chipId` and `isActive` status
   - Saves to AsyncStorage

### 5. YardDetailScreen Updates
**When Assigning Chip (New Vehicle):**
- Adds chip to active chips array when VIN is scanned and chip is assigned
- Stores complete vehicle and yard information

**When Assigning Chip (Existing Vehicle):**
- Adds chip to active chips array when assigning to existing vehicle
- Updates chip data with vehicle information

## Data Structure

### Active Chip Object
```javascript
{
  chipId: "2CF7F1C07190019F",
  vehicleId: "1234567890",
  vin: "1HGBH41JXMN109186",
  make: "Honda",
  model: "Accord",
  year: "2021",
  yardId: "yard123",
  yardName: "North Parking Yard",
  assignedAt: "2025-10-08T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

### Inactive Chip Object
```javascript
{
  chipId: "2CF7F1C07190019F",
  lastVehicleId: "1234567890",
  lastVin: "1HGBH41JXMN109186",
  lastMake: "Honda",
  lastModel: "Accord",
  lastYear: "2021",
  lastYardId: "yard123",
  lastYardName: "North Parking Yard",
  unassignedAt: "2025-10-08T13:45:67.890Z"
}
```

## User Flow

### Assigning a Chip
1. User scans VIN in YardDetailScreen or navigates to VehicleDetailsScreen
2. User clicks "Assign Chip" button
3. User scans chip barcode
4. System validates chip (checks for duplicates)
5. Chip is assigned to vehicle
6. **NEW:** Chip is saved to active chips array in local storage
7. HomeScreen active chip count increases

### Unassigning a Chip
1. User navigates to VehicleDetailsScreen of a vehicle with assigned chip
2. User clicks "Unassign Chip" button
3. Confirms unassignment
4. **NEW:** Chip is moved from active to inactive chips array
5. Vehicle's chip data is cleared
6. HomeScreen inactive chip count increases, active chip count decreases

### Reassigning an Inactive Chip
1. User navigates to HomeScreen
2. Clicks on "Inactive Chips" card
3. Views list of inactive chips with last vehicle info
4. Clicks "Assign Vehicle" button on a chip
5. Selects a yard from the list
6. Selects a vehicle (without chip) from that yard
7. Confirms assignment
8. **System automatically:**
   - Assigns chip to selected vehicle
   - Moves chip from inactive to active array
   - Updates HomeScreen counts
   - Vehicle becomes active with chip

## Storage Keys
- `active_chips` - Array of active chip objects
- `inactive_chips` - Array of inactive chip objects
- `yard_{yardId}_vehicles` - Vehicles in each yard (existing)
- `parking_yards` - List of yards (existing)

## Benefits
1. **Centralized Chip Management:** Single source of truth for chip data
2. **Historical Data:** Inactive chips retain last vehicle information
3. **Easy Reassignment:** Streamlined process to reassign inactive chips
4. **Real-time Counts:** HomeScreen always shows accurate chip counts
5. **Better UX:** Clear distinction between active and inactive chips
6. **Data Persistence:** All chip data survives app restarts

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Assign chip to vehicle → Check active chips array and HomeScreen count
- [ ] Unassign chip → Check inactive chips array and HomeScreen count
- [ ] Click Active Chips card → Verify active chips display with vehicle info
- [ ] Click Inactive Chips card → Verify inactive chips display with last vehicle info
- [ ] Reassign inactive chip → Select yard → Select vehicle → Verify chip moves to active
- [ ] Check HomeScreen counts after each operation
- [ ] Restart app → Verify all chip data persists

## Notes
- Low Battery Chips feature uses mock data (20% of active chips)
- Chip validation checks for duplicates across all yards
- System prevents reassigning chips that are already active
- All chip operations are logged to console for debugging
